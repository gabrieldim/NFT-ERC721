### NFT-ERC721 - Non-Fungible Token Based on the ERC-721 standard.
The idea behind this project is through a smart contract that implements the ERC-721 standard for NFT's to create an NFT that will be placed on the OpenSea platform. </br>
After successfully compiling and executing the code, the expected result is to get a link in the console that will lead directly to the platform and after opening the link, the already created NFT should be shown.
Sometimes it takes a few minutes to load the platform metadata, so if it doesn't show right away, it's recommended to reload the link after a few minutes. </br>
In the console it will be possible to see how much NFT Gas fees will be required to place the desired NFT on the platform. In doing so I will show how the value of ETH decreases in MetaMask on the browser.
